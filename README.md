# Restart to the same OS with Windows Boot Manager

This repo has 2 folders with self-descriptive names.
Inside each of them is another README.md file with detailed instructions.

The main idea behind them was to fix the annoying problem of having to sit in front of a screen, to select the not-default Windows installation while I selected `update and shutdown` from the start menu. If I didn't do that, the computer would restart and boot into the default Windows installation, ***not finish updating the not-default one*** and ***not be shut down***. Exactly the opposite of what I would except from the `update and shutdown` option ðŸ™ƒ. I hope it will be a useful tool for someone else as well.

<Sub>*coded with having in mind only multi boots of Windows OSes using Windows Boot Manager</Sub>
